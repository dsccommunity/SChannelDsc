The SChannelDsc PowerShell module provides DSC resources that can be used to
manage SChannel settings. It is based of the [cSchannel](https://github.com/bdanse/cSchannel)
resource created by Bart Danse.

## Documentation

The documentation can be found in the [SChannelDsc Wiki](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SChannelDsc/wiki).

documentation on each PR merge.

## Installation

To manually install the module, download the source code and unzip the contents
of the \Modules\SChannelDsc directory to the
$env:ProgramFiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules folder

To install from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SChannelDsc)
using PowerShellGet (in PowerShell 5.0) run the following command:

```PowerShell
Find-Module -Name SChannelDsc -Repository PSGallery | Install-Module
```

To confirm installation, run the below command and ensure you see the
SChannel DSC resoures available:

```PowerShell
Get-DscResource -Module SChannelDsc
```

## Requirements

The minimum PowerShell version required is 4.0, which ships in Windows 8.1
or Windows Server 2012R2 (or higher versions). The preferred version is
PowerShell 5.0 or higher, which ships with Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016.
This is discussed [on the SChannelDsc wiki](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SChannelDsc/wiki/Remote%20sessions%20and%20the%20InstallAccount%20variable),
but generally PowerShell 5 will run the SChannel DSC resources faster and
with improved verbose level logging.
